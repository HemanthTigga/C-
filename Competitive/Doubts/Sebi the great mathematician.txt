Sebi, the great mathematician
Sebi likes solving mathematical problems a lot. He spends a lot of time in getting expertise in mathematics. One day his friend gave a problem. In order to prove it expertise, he need to solve this problem.
Sebi is given two integers A and B. He has to calculate the sum of distances between each pair of numbers belonging in the interval [A, B].
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains integers A, B.  
Constraints:
1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10^50000
Time limit = 1 sec
Output Format:
The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the text. Given that the number could be extremely large, output answer modulo 1000000007.  
Sample Input 1:
288 291 
Sample Output 1:
76
Sample Input 2:-
1 5
Sample Output 2:
40

The other distances are, respectively, (289, 290) = 10, (289, 291) = 9, (290, 291) = 1. Each of them counts twice, which is in total 2 * (1 + 9 + 8 + 10 + 9 +1) = 76.
