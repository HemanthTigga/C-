Rohit's Chessboard
Rohit has a chessboard with N rows and just three columns. His friend Varsha has written an integer on each field. Rohit has K dominoes at his disposal, their dimensions being 2x1, and has to arrange all of them on the board without overlapping, in a way that each domino covers exactly two fields of the board. He can rotate the dominoes as he pleases.
Help Rohit cover the largest sum of numbers possible with the dominoes!
Input Format:
The first line of input contains the integer N, the number of rows, and K, the number of dominoes available.
Each of the following N lines contains three integers say X,Y,Z written in the ith row of the board. 
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K ≤ 1000
1 ≤ |X,Y,Z| ≤ 1000000
Time limit = 2 sec
Output Format:
The first and only line of output must contain the maximal sum possible to cover with exactly K dominoes.   
Sample Input 1:-
5 3
2 1 -1
1 3 2
0 2 3
2 1 1
3 3 0 
Sample Output 1:
16
Sample Input 2:
2 2
0 4 1
3 5 1 
Sample Output 2:
13
Explanation:
For testcase 1:
It is optimal to place all dominoes horizontally and along the right edge of the second row, right edge of the third row and along the left edge of the final row. 
Total Sum = (2+3)+(2+3)+(3+3) = 16
